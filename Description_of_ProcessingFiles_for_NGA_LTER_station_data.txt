PROCESSING LEVELS:
CTD Profiles:
    Level 0 - raw instrument data in SeaBird Electronics (SBE) binary data format
    Level 1 - ASCII output of SBE data processing routines (.cnv)
    Level 2 - Editted data in UAF's MATLAB-friendly ASCII format (.ascii and .hdr)
    Level 3 - netCDF (.nc) and tidy ASCII (.csv) versions of Level 2 data
    Level 4 - will include corrected versions of chlorophyll and oxygen (not yet)

Here is longer description of L1, L2, and L3 based on Liz's CTD Station Data ELD 3/4/2022:

L1 (via SBE data processing):
1) Conversion
2) Filter
3) Align
4) Thermal Mass Correction
5) Derive to check
5) Seaplot to check descent rate, surface soak, and salinity spikes
7) Loop Edit
8) Wild Edit - added to the workflow last year because of bad termination on SKQ that caused a lot of noise
9) Derive
10) Copies of this result to Brita (and SUNA processing?)
11) Bin Averaging to 1 dbar bins
12) Bottle Summary

L2 (via MATLAB):
The matlab part of this is Liz's MATLAB version of Seths's code.
1)Something gets sucked into conductivity cell
2)“Jitter” from a bad connection included in the average values
3)Surface values on downcast very different from upcast
4)Waves pull the CTD up and down which throws of the Thermal Mass correction
    i)Usually worse at shallow depths 
    ii) Seen in several casts in row, typically before a gap in sampling when they run for cover.
5)Downcast is completely a mess but upcast is OK, so use that instead. (Make note in .hdr file)

Basically, this code checks to make sure downcasts are the appropirate choice. Its a hands on process. 

L3 (via Python):
The python code then takes in the MATLAB produced data above and does several things to it.
 1) Rearranges data to conform to NGA LTER Best Practices.
 2) make a netcdf file.
